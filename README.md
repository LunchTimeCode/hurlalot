# Hurlalot
A hurl scratch pad https://silenloc.github.io/hurlalot/

## Using Hurlalot

This project depends on:
https://github.com/SilenLoc/hurlalot_server

The goal is to be able to user your own running instance of the server.

Use it as a scratch pad that will tell you if your hurl file is valid or not at what line and column.
Almost an IDE for hurl

## Hurl is great

To be honest hurl is 80 percent of this project and it will also stay like that, as the cli tool is really good and the only thing it does not cover is not having a gui to inspect the file in a nice way.
I would like to have an LSP and maybe I will try to create one soon. This is the replacement for it until then for me.
