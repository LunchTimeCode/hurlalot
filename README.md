# hurlalot
A hurl scratch pad

## Using hurlalot

Compile as you see in the just recipe or use the artifacts in the release

In the future there will be a server that can check the file for you
https://github.com/SilenLoc/hurlalot_server

Use it as a scratch pad that will tell you if your hurl file is valid or not at what line and column.
Almost an IDE for hurl

## Hurl is great

To be honest hurl is 80 percent of this project and it will also stay like that, as the cli tool is really good and the only thing it does not cover is not having a gui to inspect the file in a nice way.

I would like to have an LSP and maybe I will try to create one soon. This is the replacement for it until then for me.
