Not sure...

I am not sure about the layout, if you have ideas please create an issue or a pr.



Feature wise it is as complete as hurl_core, as I use it to parse the file.

There are still improvements to do, the biggest one is error messages and contextual information about the error.
Another improvment would be to add more hurl examples.

## Hurl is great

To be honest hurl is 80 percent of this project and it will also stay like that, as the cli tool is really good and the only thing it does not cover is it not having a gui to inspect the file in a nice way.

I would like to have an LSP and maybe I will try to create one soon. This is the replacement for it until then for me.
